== Preface

=== General Information

* MSTS is the Microsoft Train Simulator
* {OR} or ORTS is an open source train simulator that can utilize MSTS Assets
* While {OR} is a new train simulator that can use MSTS assets, it does not come with additional utilities, such as a Route Editor, Activities Editor or Consist Editor

=== What is TSRE5? 

* TSRE5 is Game Engine that is compatible with MSTS and {OR}
* TSRE stands for Train Sim Route Explorer, the name I gave my "university homework"
* 5 is 5th version of this engine

=== Who is behind TSRE5?

The TSRE open source project is the creation of Piotr Gadecki who often goes by the nickname "GokuMK" or "Goku" on the train simulation related forums. The Source Code for TSRE5 is maintained by GokuMK on GITHUB at https://github.com/GokuMK/TSRE5


=== What can the TSRE5 program do? 

The functional components of TSRE5 are:

* Route Editor
* Track Viewer
* Activity Editor 
* Consist Editor (Which is enabled using a command line option with TSRE)


=== Why does TSRE5 exist?

{OR} needs developer utilities. MSTS needs utilities that are not stuck in the 1990's.  TSRE can solve these issues.

The utilities supplied with the Microsoft Train Simulator have always seemed a bit unpolished and in general have had to some unusual behaviors.  These behaviors include crashing at various times while editing or the random corruption of data files that can possibly lose you hours of work.

The TSRE5 application attempts to resolve some of these _new needs_ and _legacy issues_ by creating a brand new Route, Activity and Consist editor from scratch. It is fully compatible with the files created and used by the original MSTS utilities.

The TSRE5 application is for content developers who wish to create or edit routes, consists and activities for {OR} or MSTS.

=== TSRE is now Open Source

The TSRE5 project is now open source and can be found at https://github.com/GokuMK/TSRE5. 

Some programmers have forked the project and have created their own versions of the program, including a 64 Bit version.  These versions are not supported by the original author of TSRE5.  The original author of TSRE5 is not responsible for any issues that may arise from using these versions.

Versions older than 0.8 are considered stable originals of the program.  Versions 0.8 and newer are considered forked beta versions not created by the original author.  Compiled versions of these newer development versions can be downloaded from http://www.trainsim.com file library.

Instructions on how to compile your own version of TSRE5 can also be found at http://www.trainsim.com forum.

=== How to Download TSRE5 


The latest version of TSRE5 is always available for download here: http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/?C=M;O=D

For example, you would download:  http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/TSRE5_v0.6955.exe as of January 2018.

[NOTE]
 If you have 32 bit Windows (usually foe use with an older computer), you would download: http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/TSRE5x32_v0.6951.exe

==== Installing TSRE5

[NOTE]
   While the download file is an installer of sorts, it is not a "Windows" installer. The program will run from where ever you placed it so make sure you place the downloaded file where you want TSRE to permanently run from.

[WARNING]
  Please do not put the TSRE .exe file into C:\Program Files or C:\Program Files (x86). If you install your MSTS into \Program Files\ or \program Files (x86)\ expect problems due to Microsoft Security controls.  TSRE will not operate correctly in a *system* managed folder like these . You must place the *EXE* somewhere else, like maybe a new folder you that you name `C:\Programs\TSRE\`.
 
Run the *EXE* file that was downloaded. The TSRE executable will download the additional application data from the server.

===== Manually Installing the additional TSRE application data 

If the automatic installation download doesnâ€™t work for you ( for instance, if you have Windows XP or no internet connection), download latest ZIP version from here: http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/appdata/ and then unzip into the desired directory location `tsre_appdata`):

===== What gets installed by the additional download?

[IMAGE]
image::images/install1.png[]

Example Path to the shader directory:   `./tsre_appdata/0.69/shaders/`

If TSRE isn't working right, check to see that your installation folders look similar to this. 


==== Linking TSRE to Your Simulator Files

For TSRE to operate properly, you need to have some pre-existing simulator data folders on your computer.  This is referred to as `gameRoot` in this document. 

Possible `gameRoot` locations are:

* The MSTS root  (Where `train.exe` is located)
* An {OR} installation profile
* A Mini Route directory
* Any other Directory that has "global", "routes" and "trains" directories inside. 

<<<
=== Linux

You can also download a Linux native version.  The Linux release is only available as a 64 bit version. 

The Linux version requires all of the files and directories that are located under the Root Directory, (gameRoot), to have lowercase names only.  Windows is generally a case insensitive operating system when it comes to file names, so `texture.ACE` and `Texture.Ace` refer to the same file in Windows.  This is not true with Linux. 

For example,  in an `.s` file there might be a reference to `TEXTURE.ACE`, but in the hard drive it is named `Texture.ACE`. Linux does not see these as the same file.  To deal with this issue,  the Linux TSRE program always looks for only lowercase file names. 

An example script to change all the filenames lowercase on Linux would be: 

[source,shell]
----
  rename 's!/([^/]*/?)$!\L/$1!' **/* 
----

_(It might require running it several times)_. 

There are also Windows based tools like "Bulk Rename" http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php that can process the files before being moved to a Linux platform.

[#settings]
=== How to Manually Configure TSRE5 

Persistent Settings for TSRE can be managed using  the `settings.txt` in the program folder where `tsre5.exe` is located. 

[NOTE]
  Configuring the `settings.txt` file is optional but it can be very helpful. Since the program is still under development, this list of options can change.

==== How does `settings.txt` work?

Any line in the `Settings.txt` file that begins with {cmt} is _commented out_ and is therefore *DISABLED*.  So, to *enable* the AASAMPLES option in the first line, you would edit the `SETTINGS.TXT` file the TSRE folder with  the text editor of your choice and delete the {cmt}  in front of AASAMPLES.


Below is a sample settings file. Some parts of it need to be modified with content that is related to you personally such as folder locations and online map tool keys.

|===					


[NOTE]
If the comment says *new* and nothing else... we still need a good explanation of what it's supposed to do.

=== Changes


What's new:


8.004 adds the following:

* Default offset from track centerline added for signal and milepost placement (sigOffset setting)
* Reload Marker Files (file menu)
* Show Speedposts in Marker dropdowns automatically (similar to Sidings and Platforms)
* Adds all shapes in Route\Shapes directory to an "Non-Indexed" category on the Objects pane
* Add "reload settings" function which will reload some (not all) of the values from Settings.txt
* Addresses multiple paths for include files
* Add new Settings token MapAPIKey (optionally separates this from being included in the URL)
* Warning message given if trying to rename a track or static shapefile to file that doesn't exist in the appropriate Shapes directory
* Fixes Mass calculations into metric tonnes for commonly supported units (lb, kg, t-us, t-uk)
* Reduced logging messages while debugOutput = false
* New settings tokens to disable ORTS default texture handling:

* imageSubstitution = false will only use texture type defined in shapefile (Will not affect TERRTEX files)
* imageUpgrade = false will not show DDS if both ACE and DDS are providedâ€‹

Changes from v8.003

* Fixes platform left/right line heights
* Optional support for ViewsphereDB and VDbID entries in world file objects as these aren't used by OpenRails
* Added mouse wheel support for zooming in/out as long as objects aren't selected
* Added Provider name to Map Loading Page (taken from URL in Settings) and disables satellite map loading if no URL is specified
* Added new offset value in Settings.txt to correct for zoom level differences in URL and restore Z17/Z18 selection for MapBox
* Copy Position and Position/Rot now includes tile
* Dynamic curves now up to 15000m
* Extended debug logging on/off via Settings txt
* Fixes multiple JNodePosN entries
* Enable revised symbols for interactive objects (signal, speedpost, platform, siding) via Settings.txt
* Maximum auto-placement distance now configurable via Settings.txt
* Camera elevation above terrain can default to locked via Settings.txt
* â€‹Consist Editor now supports adding ORTS EOTD's to consists
* Consist Editor displays ORFreightAnimations including Load-OR files
* Activity Editor should no longer crash in the Traffic Editor when clicking on the Time tool
* Option to have detailed or simplified logging via Settings.txt
* Corrected startup window position issues on multiple monitor for Consist Editor and Shape Viewer
* Configurable rail position and size for dynamic track rendering
* Status Window to show modal features: Camera Lock, Camera Terrain Lock, AutoTDBSave, StickToTerrain, Terrain Brushes, and Rotate/Transform/Resize
* Unsaved dialog now works when track is added or removed from the TDB
* Data precision rolled back to 7 decimal places, which should eliminate excessive decimal values for some items, and may have fixed broken vectors (zigzags)
* Adds Camera placement and rotation options
* Adds "Tangent" calculation logicâ€‹
* â€‹Settings values are no longer case sensitive
* Settings values to activate features can be any of the following: 1, true, on
* Last saved timer
* Option to display terrain elevation in feet
* Double click on route name to Load route


v8.003

* New symbols for platform and siding objects, signal objects and speedposts.
* (Removes support for ViewsphereDB and VDbID entries in world file objects as these aren't used by OpenRails (legacySupport setting)
* Added mouse wheel support for zooming in/out as long as objects aren't selected
* Status updates for modal features displayed in the Navi box for AutoTDBSave, StickToTerrain, Terrain Brushes, and Rotate/Transform/Resize
* Added Provider name to Map Loading Page (taken from URL in Settings) and disables satellite map loading if no URL is specified
* Copy Position and Position/Rot now includes tile to avoid pastes near tile boundary to appear in the expected position
* Dynamic curves now supported up to 15000m radius
* Extended debug logging on/off in Settings txt
* Fixes multiple JNodePosN entries
* EOTD support
* Fixes seasonal editing
* Adds Camera placement and rotation options
* Adds "Tangent" calculation logic
* Adds "last saved" timer
* Allow display of terrain elevation in feet
* Double-click route name in load window to Load
* legacySupport --- this will eventually be used to allow you to save MSTS ViewSphereDBID's in shapefiles. Those lines aren't needed by ORTS, so the default is already set to false. It's currently dormant, but the setting is there for when it goes live.
* newSymbols = true -- this triggers the new arrow shapes for interactives where applicable. Setting to false will go back to the pyramid shapes.
* maxAutoPlacement = 999 ---- this was requested for increasing autoplacement from 999m to 9999m. I decided to make it configurable. It's tested up to 10Km, and may work further than that. Autoplacement stops at the next junction node regardless of this setting.â€‹
* Fixes MapBox with an updated setting and a new setting:
* ImageMapsUrl = https://api.mapbox.com/styles/v1/mapbox/satellite-v9/static/{lon},{lat},{zoom}/{res}x{res}?access_token=yourApiTokenValue imageMapsZoomOffset = -1
* Added Status Windows for modal features: Camera, AutoTDBSave, StickToTerrain, Terrain Brushes, and Rotate/Transform/Resize


[NOTE]
Within the last year, the zoom function was broken by a change at MapBox. This fix restores the ability to go between Z17 and Z18 on the fly as you can with Google Maps.

0.8.002

* 64 Bit Support
* Added new settings:

  wireLineHeight = 6.7         // sets the yellow TDB line height to help position catenary/bridges
  sectionLineHeight = 5        // sets the grey Tsection line that people probably don't notice is there
  terrainSize = 1              // sets the cut/fill size value
  terrainEmbankment = 2        // sets the cut/fill embankment value

  terrainRadius = 9            // sets the cut/fill radius value
  terrainBrushSize = 1         // sets the terrain brush size
  terrainBrushIntensity = 12   // sets the terrain brush intensity
  selectedTerrWidth=4          // sets the width of the terrain tile selection lines
  selectedTerrColor = #FFB612  // sets the color for terrain tile selection lines
  selectedWidth=2              // sets the width of the object selection lines
