== Preface

=== General Information

* MSTS is the Microsoft Train Simulator
* {OR} or ORTS is an open source train simulator that can utilize MSTS Assets
* While {OR} is a new train simulator that can use MSTS assets, it does not come with additional utilities, such as a Route Editor, Activities Editor or Consist Editor

=== What is TSRE5? 

* TSRE5 is Game Engine that is compatible with MSTS and {OR}
* TSRE stands for Train Sim Route Explorer, the name I gave my "university homework"
* 5 is 5th version of this engine

=== Who is behind TSRE5?

The TSRE open source project is the creation of Piotr Gadecki who often goes by the nickname "GokuMK" or "Goku" on the train simulation related forums. The Source Code for TSRE5 is maintained by GokuMK on GITHUB at https://github.com/GokuMK/TSRE5


=== What can the TSRE5 program do? 

The functional components of TSRE5 are:

* Route Editor
* Track Viewer
* Activity Editor 
* Consist Editor (Which is enabled using a command line option with TSRE)


=== Why does TSRE5 exist?

{OR} needs developer utilities. MSTS needs utilities that are not stuck in the 1990's.  TSRE can solve these issues.

The utilities supplied with the Microsoft Train Simulator have always seemed a bit unpolished and in general have had to some unusual behaviors.  These behaviors include crashing at various times while editing or the random corruption of data files that can possibly lose you hours of work.

The TSRE5 application attempts to resolve some of these _new needs_ and _legacy issues_ by creating a brand new Route, Activity and Consist editor from scratch. It is fully compatible with the files created and used by the original MSTS utilities.

The TSRE5 application is for content developers who wish to create or edit routes, consists and activities for {OR} or MSTS.

=== How to Download TSRE5 


The latest version of TSRE5 is always available for download here: http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/?C=M;O=D

For example, you would download:  http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/TSRE5_v0.6955.exe as of January 2018.

[NOTE]
 If you have 32 bit Windows (usually foe use with an older computer), you would download: http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/TSRE5x32_v0.6951.exe

==== Installing TSRE5

[NOTE]
   While the download file is an installer of sorts, it is not a "Windows" installer. The program will run from where ever you placed it so make sure you place the downloaded file where you want TSRE to permanently run from.

[WARNING]
  If you install your MSTS into \Program Files\ or \program Files (x86)\ expect problems due to Microsoft Security.
  TSRE will not operate corretly in a *system* managed folder like these . You must place the *EXE* somewhere else, like maybe a new folder you that you name `C:\Programs\TSRE\`.
 
Run the *EXE* file that was downloaded. The TSRE executable will download the additional application data from the server.

===== Manually Installing the additional TSRE application data 

If the automatic installation download doesn’t work for you ( for instance, if you have Windows XP or no internet connection), download latest ZIP version from here: http://koniec.org/tsre5/data/appdata/ and then unzip into the desired directory location `tsre_appdata`):

===== What gets installed by the additional download?

[IMAGE]
image::images/install1.png[]

Example Path to the shader directory:   `./tsre_appdata/0.69/shaders/`

If TSRE isn't working right, check to see that your installation folders look similar to this. 


==== Linking TSRE to Your Simulator Files

For TSRE to operate properly, you need to have some pre-existing simulator data folders on your computer.  This is referred to as `gameRoot` in this document. 

Possible `gameRoot` locations are:

* The MSTS root  (Where `train.exe` is located)
* An {OR} installation profile
* A Mini Route directory
* Any other Directory that has "global", "routes" and "trains" directories inside. 

<<<
=== Linux

You can also download a Linux native version.  The Linux release is only available as a 64 bit version. 

The Linux version requires all of the files and directories that are located under the Root Directory, (gameRoot), to have lowercase names only.  Windows is generally a case insensitive operating system when it comes to file names, so `texture.ACE` and `Texture.Ace` refer to the same file in Windows.  This is not true with Linux. 

For example,  in an `.s` file there might be a reference to `TEXTURE.ACE`, but in the hard drive it is named `Texture.ACE`. Linux does not see these as the same file.  To deal with this issue,  the Linux TSRE program always looks for only lowercase file names. 

An example script to change all the filenames lowercase on Linux would be: 

[source,shell]
----
  rename 's!/([^/]*/?)$!\L/$1!' **/* 
----

_(It might require running it several times)_. 

There are also Windows based tools like "Bulk Rename" http://www.bulkrenameutility.co.uk/Main_Intro.php that can process the files before being moved to a Linux platform.

=== How to Manually Configure TSRE5 

Persistent Settings for TSRE can be managed using  the `settings.txt` in the program folder where `tsre5.exe` is located. 

[NOTE]
  Configuring the `settings.txt` file is optional but it can be very helpful. Since the program is still under development, this list of options can change.

==== How does `settings.txt` work?

Below is a sample settings file. Some parts of it need to be modified with content that is related to you personally such as folder locations and online map tool keys.

File:: "settings.txt"

[NOTE]
If the comment says *new* and nothing else... we still need a good explanation of what it's supposed to do.
