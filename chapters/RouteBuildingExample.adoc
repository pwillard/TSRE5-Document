== Route Building - Step By Step

=== Route Building 

Creating a railway route requires a variety of components.  These components should mostly be prepared in advance as they will be the items you will rely on to create your unique route. This list is not intended to be daunting to the route builder, rather it is meant to give an understanding of what is involved in a "complete" route, such as the 6 default {OR} routes.

To create a complete {OR} route, the items included would be: 

. custom terrain shapes and textures
. tracks
. rail yards
. bridges
. tunnels and other underground structures
. water
. stations
. platforms
. overhead electric wires and gantries
. signals
. speed limits
. mileposts
. roads with traffic definitions
. controlled level crossings
. refueling equipment
. static and dynamic trains
. textured houses and other buildings
. various visual objects (such as rocks, fences, junk piles, and railroad equipment)
. city objects
. industrial complexes
. people and animals
. train and environmental sounds
. and at least one defined activity. 

Constructing a thorough itinerary from the bottom up is a complicated task, even for a small route. It is essential to plan such a route systematically. This guide is designed to meet this requirement. 

[NOTE]
(Author's Notes) I was not informed at the beginning of my route-building journey about the amount of research and knowledge that would be needed to create a high-quality route. For example, I was unaware of the resources such as track profiles, Sanborn or topo maps, and hundreds of photographs that I would need to be familiar with.

Building custom models and researching the route are both very laborious tasks, taking up at least 90% of the total effort. Installing the tracks and roads is minimal in comparison, provided you understand where to put them. Static models, although requiring knowledge of modeling, are even more straightforward. Although custom models require a significant amount of work, this is mostly due to the need for correct pictures to create the art that covers them. Making Terrtex images, however, is much harder; it needs to be a consistent tile so that there is no visible pattern, and there is currently no online resource to obtain samples of Terrtex files.

[TIP]
Some available tools do make creating seamless tiles somewhat easier.  These tools include Gimp, Krita, Affinity Designer and Photoshop.

=== Route Building Tips

The best way to start is t build a small route.  With a maximum of 5 to 10 miles in size, you won't get overwhelmed when trying to figure out the route building tools.  Make something you can get operational in a short time. You will sometimes encounter errors or deign problems that would force you to backup several steps, and that is much less traumatic with a small route.


When laying tracks, the process typically involves attaching one track section at a time to the previous one. Start with the first track section and build out from there, either in one or two directions or even more if you include switches. Track laying should be done in a systematic fashion, one small section at a time. As for adding other elements, it's not as strict, but it's important to follow a certain sequence to avoid potential problems down the line.

It is essential to understand that track and terrain (mountains, valleys, etc.) are interconnected during the construction process. Usually, one shapes the landscape while laying the track. Unless one imports the terrain and track layout from an outside source (which requires more skills, software, and techniques that are not provided by {OR}), it is necessary to link the terrain shaping together with the track laying, since they are inseparable unless the ground is completely flat.

Once tracks have been laid, particularly over hills and mountains, it can be difficult to alter them. Even though the existing track can be removed, it is arduous to fill in the space left with new track. This is because it is challenging to join two tracks together within a few centimeters, especially when the ground is uneven.

Backups, backups, backups.  It is important to save "extra copies" of your work in progress as well as saving often during a session to avoid catastrophic loss of effort should the route editor crash.

Studying existing routes within the Route Editor can provide a wealth of ideas and techniques for creating your own route. Whether it be original default routes or add-on routes, you are sure to find something useful to apply to your own route.

Historically, routes in legacy MSTS had some difficulties with the use of dynamic track.  It does seem that {OR} has much less difficulty with dynamic track so using them is now much less risky. Some people are saying that using of dynamic tracks is safe for {OR} and looks and feels great since it reduces rough transitions. These days, some people are saying that they always use dynamic tracks and just use the available curve shapes for actual curve transitions.

There are many authors who have created track and road sections with textures, and these can be found online. A regularly extended database, known as the `Tsection.dat` file, contains all available track section-specific vector components. Trains and cars traverse invisible vectors, while textures are merely attached to these vectors to make them visible and more varied. Ultimately, it is up to the route author to decide which track and road sections to use in the route, taking into account the specific variables such as broad, middle, or narrow gauge, etc.

[NOTE]
Routes can be expanded later if that is desireable. 



=== Route Planning

What kind of route do you want?

* Will it use real terrain elevations, or will it be fictional?
* Will it consist of one or more mainline(s), dual-tracked or otherwise, yards, sidings,
spurs, loops, wyes, bridges, tunnels, overpasses, grades, switchbacks?
* What kind of terrain will you need to make?
* Where will be the stations, towns, hills, mountains, valleys, rivers, lakes be?
* How much detail do you want to include. 

Planning ahead is essential for building a successful model railroad. Begin by sketching out a rough map of the desired route, allowing room for potential improvisation during the actual construction. Be aware that the geographic area of the layout may be subject to expansion as you build, so a flexible plan is key.

Having a plan for your route is essential for any modeler. This is because you need to first choose a set of square tiles for your route to be situated on. Furthermore, it is important to have an understanding of where to place the bigger elements such as curves, loops, wyes, valleys, and mountains, as each tile is only about 2km by 2km square (1.24mi by 1.24mi).

[NOTE]
• 1 ft = 0.3048 m
• 1 chain (ch) = 20.1168 m
• 1 mile = 1609.34 m

[TIP]
You can make a "marker" file for guidance in laying track (this will place markers on the terrain, so you can lay your track from marker to marker). But this requires that you know the GPS coordinates of each marker: these are not so easy to generate, especially for free-style routes. 

[NOTE]
Peter at "Coals to Newcastle" website has also created a resource page dedicated to a "getting started with route building" tutorial and is well worth the visit.

=== Beginning a New Route

1. Create a new route in TSRE.
2. Choose a name for the route. `Name ID: My_New_Route` This will be the name in all the Sub-folder files
3. Choose a Geographical area for the route. Latitude and Longitude are in decimal degrees. This will position the geological starting point for the route.
4. Route Display Name: This is the name that will be displayed in the route list and will not change the folder names used above.
5. Set "Terrain Error Scale" to 0 for best performance. This controls the number of Polys/faces shown in each tile. You can increase this number to get a better view of the terrain, but it will take longer to load.

At this point you will have a folder structure for your route and it will be populated with a default set of track sections, content and configuration files. TSRE also creates the initial terrain tile based on the geographical area you selected.

=== Tsection.dat files

There are two `Tsection.dat` files: The `GLOBAL/Tsection.datfile` is a regularly extended database of all common road and track sections and provides the Open Rails Train Simulator with invisible vectors along which trains and cars travel. The route's Local <route>/Tsection.datfile
is for storing data about dynamic tracks used in this route only. Note that track and road objects are stored in the `GLOBAL/Shapes` folder while their textures(.ace or .dds) are stored in your your route’s local `Textures`` folder.


=== Scenery Objects

The scenery objects for your route are stored in the `<route>/Shapes` folder. These are the objects that are used to flesh out the route. The `GLOBAL/Shapes and GLOBAL/textures` folder contains default items supplied for use in all routes like rail sections so you should not place your scenery items there. 



=== Laying Track with gradients

==== Tips for Placing and Rotating Tracks for Gradients
*From Vince Cockeram*

[TIP]
When Elevating track, remember the 'snap' elevation settings to get a smooth gradient transition. 0.150, 0.300, 0.450, 0.600 and so on.

==== Rotating Tracks for Gradient

1. Place a track section in TSRE

2. Press keyboard kbd:[R]. This puts just installed track section in ROTATE Mode.

3. Holding the keyboard kbd:[CTRL] key down, tap either kbd:[NumPad 8] for up or kbd:[NumPad 2] for down.

4. The track will elevate or descend in *0.1 per-cent steps* with each key tap of kbd:[NumPad 8] or kbd:[NummPad 2].

5. The *0.1 grade per-cent* is equal to *1.0 per-mille* which is equal to *0.058 degrees* ({OR} measurement) steps.

6. *All three of these gradient values are displayed on the TSRE panel, left side.* 

7. If you want a very smooth a gradient transition, use 1.5 meter track sections with each sections elevation greater or less than the previous track section by 0.1 per-cent or 1.0 per-mille or 0.058 degrees.
It will look less smooth but will still look good when you elevate / descend in 0.2 percent steps.


When manually entering the numbers into the gradient section of the panel you must use a two place decimal, where 1 percent (per hundred) is entered as 1.00 and is equal to 10 permille (per thousand) which must be entered as 10.00 in the permille field and 0.1 percent is entered as 0.10 or 1.00 permille.

[NOTE]
TSRE will strip off leading and trailing zeros when saved but this does NOT change the gradient values.

*Keyword: Practice!*

[TIP]
 There is a general consensus that using PerMille is easier than working grade percentage.


WHAT YOU ENTER IN THE GRADE FIELDS 

////  Generic Table layout Example

[width="75%",align="center"]
[cols="50,50]
|===
|PERMILLE |PERCENT
|1.00     |0.100
|2.00     | 0.200
|3.00     | 0.300 
|4.00     | 0.400
|5.00     | 0.500
|6.00     | 0.600
|7.00     | 0.700
|8.00     | 0.800
|9.00     | 0.900
|10.00    | 1.00
|===


[WARNING]
 For whatever reason if you enter, lets say, 6 permille or .6 percent when you select the track/road the 6 permille changes to 5.9996 permille or 0.59996 percent. 

*USE TWO PLACE DECIMALS IN EITHER FIELD AND IT WILL SAVE EXACTLY AS ENTERED. IF YOU FAIL TO USE 2 PLACE DECIMAL PLACES, TSRE WILL ROUND OFF NUMBERS*

*Some General thoughts from Vince about working with gradients*

Until you get used to working with gradients get down close and personal as you adjust track grade. Entering (typing) into the gradient dialog panel sometimes produces unwanted results. 


Example: I'll set (type in ) a grade of 20 in the permille field ( 2.0 percent ) and then when I have to select the already selected track section ( why do I have to re-select) in order to use the kbd:[Z] key to add track section to the TDB. (yellow lines)The gradient field 20 permille becomes 19.9998. It seems to have a arithmetic error. I want 20 permille and I get 19.99989 something? It's required to have the editor hold the grade a designer wants.

Additionally I can't figure why if I select a track section (Blue Outlined) why do I have to select (kbd:[E] key or Select Button) it again . . .and again, the need to select just about any object multiple times to perform multiple concurrent operations. 

1. select and use the Transform feature. 
2. now select the already selected (blue outlined) object if you need to move the object into a final position.


[TIP]
----
When typing grade in on the TSRE Elevation Panel there is a problem if the tracksection is 'flipped'.

When you place a curve it normally curves to the left. All works well when entering grade values in the elevation panel.

Not so if track is 'flipped' i.e. curves to the right and it's impossible to manually enter into any field in the elevation panel.

If I'm setting grade on multiple curve-to-the-right (flipped) sections it's convenient to paste a grade entry copied from text.
In the editor there is a 'Search' field on the Objects Panel a few lines from the top.
If I'm setting grade to lets say 2.5% I type 2.50 into the percent field ( or 25.00 into the permille field).
As long as you don't type into these fields it's ok and copy / paste from the Search is an easy spot to put you grade data.
----



==== Tips for Using the TRANSFORM Panel

This is very very helpful. A great feature only lacking a detailed method of Operation.

How many times have you wanted to align a platform, bridge, berm, to track on a grade? Me? A LOT!
Once I figured out (sort of) how Transform worked it is a super tool! 
I urge and recommend experimentation. Post results here. One day we can put all these 'found-out-about-features' in a FAQ.
Note that the Transform Panel has `OK` --- `Cancel` buttons. You enter your numbers and `OK` does the job. How about the same thing for the Track Grade Panel? That would eliminate the track or road moving until you are ready.

One last nit to pick: `Dynamic Track` . . . . I don't see how (other than tapping the keys I use for grade) to set a gradient for DT?
I do know that holding the kbd:[Ctrl] key down as I tap the kbd:[NumPad 2] or kbd:[NumPad 8] keys for down / up slope of 1 permille (0.1 percent) grade changes so I just count off key taps. 
A display of grade as is done for 'normal' track is preferred. 
Now add a Grade Panel OK button to set the typed in grade and we'll be cooking.

* Transform Panel - ROTATE *

(See the lower part of the panel)

Rotate will revolve or translate an object reference based on the objects PIVOT point.  This pivot point is also known as the ORIGIN that was set by the creator of that object. It can be seen as the point where the Red, Green and Blue axis lines join.

NOTE: Different objects might have requirements on where this *origin* is located, for example rail cars place a pivot point in the center of the shape, Road and Track shapes place the pivot at an extreme end of the shape while but most scenery can have the pivot point anywhere. Hopefully the modeler chose a reasonable location.

*  So, rotation (transforms) will always occur based on the origin point.
*  When an object is ROTATED or SLOPED up / down grade, the grade angle and rotation is specified in DEGREES. In the Grade Panel this angle is referred in several different ways all meaning the same thing.
*  When a TRACK is initially placed it's pointing NORTH, 0 degrees
*  If you rotate it +90 degrees the track is now pointing EAST.
*  If you rotate it -90 degrees the track is now pointing WEST.
*  If you rotate it +270 degrees the track also ends up pointing WEST.

 ALL the above examples start with the track in it's initially placed position pointing NORTH. BUT...

*  You may enter a value in the `Transform Panel` AT ANY TIME you need to 'nudge' it just a bit to achieve the alignment you want.
*  If the track is say pointing SOUTH and you need to rotate is just a few degrees, that's what you would enter into the 'Y' axis field

Now the Transform Panel Examine the lower half of the panel, the ROTATE Section.
Three Fields: 'X' 'Y' 'Z'

[IMAGE]
image::images/TransformPanel.jpg[]

* `X` is along the LENGTH of the Track Section. Enter a 1 here and the track rotates (slopes) up by 1 degree.
* `Y` is the vertical axis. The track rotates about (around) this axis.
* `Z` is across the track . . .Not exactly sure what this might do as I have not used this field. Maybe TILT the track from side to side? Experiment! Let us know what YOU find!

*Practical Uses for Transform*

Have you ever had to join track sections on a grade? Tough, especially if you're joining to an already installed section.
Getting that gradient _exactly_ right can be a pain. You've been using the grade adjust panel but exact joining just won't work.
Let's say you need to raise one end of the track by less than a centimeter (about 3/8ths of an inch). This is when you use Transform!

Conditions:
1. Track section selected, pres kbd:[Z] key so you see no yellow `TDB` lines showing for the track section
2. On the Transform Panel enter 0.01 (1 centimeter) in the `X` field and press kdb:[OK]

Result:
The track end opposite the pivot end will elevate by 1 centimeter. 

So, lets say that 0.01 was too much so you need to slope it down just a bit, by half the amount you raised it.
Enter -0.005 in the `X` field. This lowers the track by half the amount you raised it in step 2 above.


==== Some thoughts on Laying Track

[IMPORTANT]
----
Rule #1 of editing track is that there must be no interactive objects on the node being edited - a node being the section of track between two red and/or blue poles. If track is edited while interactives are present, those interactives will now be corrupted.

Also, Attaching two switch points (marked by red poles in editor) directly to each other will cause train crash in game and will be noted in LOG-file. Instead, we should always insert at least one track section between two switches.
----

When swapping track sections in and out it's better to set TSRE to NOT automatically add track into the database. 
The yellow lines over the track are a graphic representation of the TDB.

To toggle `Auto-Add TDB ON/OFF` With nothing selected press kbd:[Ctrl + Q] 

This prevents the auto-add to TDB when a track is de-selected.

This is good practice because if you move a track section without first removing the yellow TDB lines will create a MIS-MATCH between the TDB and the WORLD file. 
This is a well known 'Out of Sync' condition and it's a real pain to repair.
At this time there is no indication of kbd:[Ctrl + Q] being on or off. 
Before beginning editing you should test to see if Auto-TDB add is on or off. How?

When a *Auto-Add TDB is ON*, the Yellow TDB indicator lines will come ON when the track is deselected. 
There is no indication of Auto-TDB at this editor release level other that the above procedure. Goku is aware of the no indication.

Another use for the `Q` key: Allowing easy installing underground or on up-in-the-sky bridges.
*With nothing selected press kbd:[SHIFT + Q]"

This allows you to place the cursor ( pointer ) on any object for the purpose of placing a track or road section.
The cursor normally 'sticks' to the terrain. kbd:[Shift + Q] allows the cursor to *Stick to Anything*. 
This IS covered in the Manual. 
-
There is an error in the Manual for the entry on this in section /rewobj.html page 1 of 4 Item 5. `Shift +` is missing.
-
There is no indication of kbd:[Shift + Q] being on or off however the behavior of the cursor provides a positive indication.

* When placing track underground as for a tunnel, first check 'Hide Terrain Shape' in the View Menu
* Now, position the cursor very close to the end on the previously installed track section to place the next track section. 
* For new track to SNAP to previously installed track, the previous track section MUST have the Yellow TDB lines present.
* To add a newly placed track section to the TDB when in manual (kbd:[Ctrl + Q]) mode: 

1.Select the track. Blue outline appears. 
2. press the kbd:[Z] key. Yellow line appears & track is added to the TDB. Save to make final. 

Do NOT move the track if TDB lines are present

* Dragging track underground? _Don't try it!_ 
* Misplace or lose a track underground? (which dragging is sure to do) Press kbd:[DELETE] and do over! 

=== Placing New Tracks

How to place tracks or roads?

* Select track or road type you want.
* Select shape you want.

[IMAGE]
image::images/ret1.png[]

* Click `Place New` button.
* Click on the ground where you want new track.

[IMAGE]
image::images/ret2.png[]

* You can adjust track position by pressing kbd:[T] and using kbd:[4,6,8,2] keys (move XZ axis), kbd:[9,3] keys (move Y axis).
* You can adjust track rotation by pressing kbd:[R] and using kbd:[4,6] keys.
* You can adjust track elevation by pressing kbd:[R] and using kbd:[8,2] keys. The Properties window will show you elevation value.
* You can hold kbd:[Ctrl] with kbd:[[R] & kbd:[T] mode to change the step rate (0.10%).

[NOTE]
Depending on your keyboard layout, you can also use other keys. See _<<editor>>_.

[IMAGE]

image::images/ret3.png[]

* Press kbd:[Z] to add track to the TDB (Track DataBase). If you want to remove track from the TDB and keep the shape - press kbd:[Z] again.

[WARNING] 
 Never translate or rotate track when it is in the TDB (when it has a yellow line) !!! If you do, you will need to delete this track and place new one.

* When track is in TDB, you can press kbd:[F] to adjust terrain to the track. You can also do it later by selecting the track you want to adjust and press kbd:[F]. See more: <<Editing_terrain>>.

[IMAGE]
image::images/ret4.png[]

* If you want to place the next track, click around the endpoint (the blue pole) where you want to add next track. 
* If you have difficulty placing a track above or below ground, press kbd:[Q] to change placement mode to `stick to all`. 

[IMAGE]
image::images/ret5.png[]

* If you want to change direction of track or joining point, press kbd:[X]. *Do it before pressing kbd:[Z]!*

[IMAGE]
image::images/ret6.png[]

* If you want to delete track from TDB, but keep the shape placed, press kbd:[Z].

[IMAGE]
image::images/ret7.png[]

If you want to delete track completely, press kbd:[Delete]. In this case, you don't need to press kbd:[Z].


[TIP]
To adjust a road piece, Press kbd:[Z]. This should remove the Blue Line above the selected road.  Select the road again and attempt to drag it to where you want it connected.  It _should drag along the terrain!_  If it doesn't then toggle the Cursor Mode using kbd:[Shift+Q] Key.  You might need to try using a different road section to get it to snap correctly.

=== Placing objects - A guide

=== Car Spawning Tips

==== Creating a Car Spawner

In order to create a car spawner you need an entry in the route's REF file like this. The class can be anything, I put mine in the "vehicles" class:

----
CarSpawner (
Class (Vehicles)
Description ("Car Spawner")
StoreMatrix ()
)
----

To add a car spawner select it from the ref file list and select place new as you would for any object. When you place it on the road section you will see 2 purple squares ("handles"). Pull them apart and note which direction the traffic is flowing. If it is going in the wrong direction, pull one handle past the other to reverse them.

When you select a handle it turns a lighter shade of purple and data for the spawner will display on the left side pane.

You may move the handles either by dragging with the mouse or using the arrow keys. I am told that Selecting the "Expand" button expands the spawner to the extent of the road, but I have not tried that myself. Note that it is not recommended to have a car spawner longer than 2 km. 

Note: There is no need to drag handles over long distances. Move more than a couple of tiles away from the origin of the spawner and it will stop displaying. If you lose the handles, you can lose the ability to delete it so would need to fix it in the 'w' file (which nobody wants to do). In this case you can increase tile rendering radius "tileLod" in settings.txt and wait until cars reach location of car spawner placement and you can select car spawner by selecting a car. But that's the reason why it isn't recommended.  What to keep in mind: in {OR} car spawners longer than 2 km may cause issues, in TSRE longer than 6 km. 

The values "car number" and "car speed" affect the speed and density of traffic. The car number refers to the average number of seconds between spawning a car so higher numbers mean less traffic such as for a rural road. I have found that a car number of 1 tends to produce vehicles so fast that they are sometimes bumper to bumper or worse. Note that the spawning mechanism randomizes vehicle appearance so this is just an average number.

Car speed is in meters per second. 60 mph is approximately 27 meters/sec. I have seen a table somewhere that converts m/sec to mph but I don't recall where it was. Basically multiply mph by 0.447 to get meters per second. For kilometers per hour to meters per second multiply by 0.278.

If the car spawner handle refuses to cross a road joint it means you do not have a good joint there and you need to remove the road sections and rebuild them. Road sections can be finicky to join especially multi lane highways that sometimes will join misaligned. Roads on a grade or over a bridge can be difficult. Try using shorter road sections and turning off "stick to terrain" kbd:[Shift-Q].

[TIP]
Bad road joints can be identified by a longer blue pole at the bad joint than a standard "good" joint. Anyway as you say, the car spawner will not move past it, so thats a good enough indicator something is wrong. Try to lay roads end to end rather than trying to join them up, as the precision pieces are somewhat limited when using default shapes.

The cars spawned by the car spawner are defined by the "carspawn.dat" file in the root directory of your route. For {OR} there is only one car list. For Open Rails you can define multiple car lists. This is useful when you want to have different cars for different roads or lanes of a road. For example on my 6 lane freeway I have cars and trucks in the right 2 lanes but cars only in the left lane, which is common in many US Interstates and freeways. To set up multiple car lists see section 15.5 of the Open Rails Manual.

==== Markers

[TIP]
Well, with TSRE, once You've modified a track, platform marker won't disappear immediately, but if You'll try to move it then - it will. I also have seen, it's only one end disappeared first. But anyway, the only sense of them is to see their names for copy and paste to new ones, and, as You've said - the reminder. Once You've touch them - it already will be too late, so we should care to delete them first, As Travis suggests.
