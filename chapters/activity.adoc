If you want to set later station arrival or depart time, enter new time and click `Calculate` again.
If you want to remove longer station stops, remove all timetable vales and click `Calculate`.

[TIP]
The timetable calculation is based on max speed and max acceleration values from consist file. You can modify consist acceleration by editing performance column

=== Working with Paths

TSRE path editor is still under development. Now TSRE can’t edit paths, but you can choose path from the list and use Edit button to see it.


[IMAGE]
image::images/paths1.png[]

[WARNING]
Current version of TSRE will crash if selected path is broken.

[IMAGE]

Step 8:: Make a pickup (This feature is not complete)

*Location Event*

To set new location, click Pick new location button and click on the track you want the event. 
To jump to event location, click Jump to location button.
You can set event radius.

Radius:: This parameter should define the "tolerance" of the location event; in other words, when the front of the train is at a distance of the location event which is less than Range (in meters), the location event is considered as hit. It is reasonable that, if such parameter is set at 0, the location event will never be hit, because the distance check is not continuous.

[IMAGE]
image::images/events8.png[]

*Time Event*

Enter activation time of the event relative from activity beginning. 

[IMAGE]
image::images/events9.png[]

*Outcomes*

Item 1:: None.

Empty outcome. Removed on route save.

Item 2:: Display a message.

Enter message in the text box below. Message window will be shown during simulation when event is activated.

[IMAGE]
image::images/events10.png[]

Item 3:: Complete Activity successfully.
Item 4:: End Activity without success.

End activity with or without success. 

Item 5:: Increases an event's activation level
Item 6:: Decreases an event's activation level
Item 7:: Restore an event's activation level

Read more about it in Open Rails Manual: 
`10.16.4 LocationEventandTimeEventSoundFile`

[IMAGE]
image::images/events12.png[]

Item 12:: Change the weather

Choose weather change from Weather Change List.

[IMAGE]
image::images/events13.png[]

TSRE requires new file in route directory: `weathertransitions.dat`
This file contains list of `ORTSWeatherChanges` that can be chosen in `Outcome` properties.
Editing this file using TSRE is not yet possible. You need to use a text editor.

Read more about ORTSWeatherChange in Open Rails Manual: 
`10.16.5 WeatherChangeActivityEvent`

[IMAGE]
image::images/events14.png[]

`ORTSWeatherChanges` added to activity file by hand using Open Rails guide are not visible in TSRE outcome list, but are properly loaded and saved. If you want to change the event WeatherChange using TSRE, just add new Weather Outcome and the weather definition will be replaced.

=== Activity Creation Tutorial

==== Step 1: Prepare Consists

Use the Consist Editor to build all train sets you need.

Save each consist with clear names (for example: PlayerFreight.con, AIExpress.con).

==== Step 2: Prepare Paths

In Track Viewer, lay out paths for each service (player and AI).

Save paths with descriptive names (for example: PlayerMainline.pat, AI_Siding.pat).

==== Step 3: Create the Player Service

. Open TSRE Activity Editor.
. Create a new activity (menu:File[New Activity]).
. Add a Player Service:

Assign the player consist.

Select the player path.

Set start time and starting location.

Define performance parameters (speed limits, timetable if needed).

==== Step 4: Add AI Services

. Add additional services for AI trains.
. Assign each AI service a consist and path.
. Set start times so they interact with the player train.
. Adjust priorities (express vs. local) to control dispatcher behavior.

==== Step 5: Define Events & Instructions

Add station stops or pickup/drop-off events for the player service.

Use instructions such as "wait for 2 minutes" or "pickup cars".

Test timing so AI trains cross paths realistically.

==== Step 6: Create a Traffic File

Traffic files (.trf) define background traffic patterns for your activity.
Use the following procedure in TSRE:

. In TSRE, open the Activity Editor and select Traffic.
. Create a new traffic file (menu:File[New Traffic]).
. Add AI services into the traffic file:

Each service requires a consist, path, and start time.

You may reuse paths and consists already created.
. Configure service details:

Priority: determines dispatcher handling (express, passenger, freight).

Start time: controls when the AI train enters the activity.

Repeat interval: optional, for recurring services.
. Save the traffic file with a clear name (for example: LocalTraffic.trf).
. Link the traffic file to your activity:

In the Activity Editor, assign the traffic file to the activity.

This ensures AI trains spawn according to the traffic file.

==== Step 7: Test & Refine

Run the activity in Open Rails.

Watch for conflicts (AI collisions, missed meets).

Adjust start times, paths, or priorities in TSRE until the activity flows correctly.

==== Quick Checklist

 Build consists in Consist Editor

 Create paths in Track Viewer

 Create player service in TSRE

 Add AI services in TSRE

 Define events and instructions

 Build traffic file (.trf) in TSRE

 Link traffic file to activity

 Test in Open Rails

[NOTE]
Any time you edit the Traffic File, reselect the Traffic File in the top menu before saving.
This is a known TSRE quirk.
